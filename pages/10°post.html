                            A forgotten branch of psychology is the one that try to answer and explore various question
                            using the <strong>experimental method</strong>. What factors influence how we react in
                            stressing situation?
                            How do our experiences shape our character? Why do people agree on statements they do not
                            usually support? These are just a few of the questions that psychologists explore
                            <br>
                            Experimental methods
                            allow researchers to create and empirically test hypotheses. By studying such questions,
                            researchers can also develop theories that enable them to describe, explain, predict, and
                            even change human behaviors or they can search for effective ways to help people avoid such
                            actions or replace unhealthy choices.
                            <br>
                            </br>
                            In the experimental method, psychologists can determine if there is a cause-and-effect
                            relationship between different variables. The basics of conducting a psychology experiment
                            involve:
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Randomly assigning</strong> participants to groups</li>
                            <li>Operationally defining variables</li>
                            <li>Developing a hypothesis</li>
                            <li>Manipulating the <strong>independent variables</strong></li>
                            <li>Measuring the <strong>dependent variables</strong></li>
                        </ul>
                        <strong>Social psychologists</strong> utilize experimental techniques to study how people are
                        influenced by groups. They work in a wide variety of settings including colleges, universities,
                        research centers, government, and private businesses.
                        <br>
                        The first psychologist to distinguish psychology as a science, independent from biology and
                        philosophy, was <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wilhelm_Wundt" target="_blank">Wilhelm Wundt</a>. He
                        is recognized as the founding father of the discipline and the founder of the first formal
                        laboratory for psychological research in 1879. Thanks to this, he is also recognized as the
                        father of experimental psychology.
                        <br>
                        </br>
                        Since then, lots of psychologists started to explore this branch of psychology, doing researches
                        and publishing studies: some famous one are the (<a

                        <br>
                        </br>
                        Today, I would like to talk about of a very known and controversial experiment: the
                        <strong>Milgram experiment</strong> on obedience to authority. Stanley Milgram was an American
                        social psychologist, became famous for this widely discussed experiment. He was influenced by
                        the trial of Adolf Eichmann in developing his experiment. For instance, Eichmann in the trial
                        was defending himself by saying that he was only following orders. That same year, Milgram began
                        his experiments to see how far people would go in inflicting pain and suffering on fellow humans
                        if given orders to do so.
                        <br>
                        </br>
                        Milgram organized an experiment on the role of punishments on learning, in which one subject was
                        the teacher who asked questions and another was the student who had to answer. The teacher, the
                        real experimental subject, after having witnessed the student's accommodation, sat in an
                        adjacent room in front of a false electric current generator composed of thirty switches with
                        labels indicating the intensity of the electric shock: from 15 volts to 450 volts.
                        <br>
                        The teacher felt the shock of the third switch (45volts) in order to personally convince himself
                        that there were no fictions. In fact, that was the only real shock; all the other shocks that
                        the teacher administered to the pupil were fake. The pupil was, for instance, a Milgram’s
                        associate trained to feign pain when the shock was administered.
                        <br>
                        </br>
                        The teacher’s tasks were to read pairs of words (for example: "blue box") and ask the student
                        what was the correct association between four alternatives (for example: "blue: car, water, box,
                        lamp"). The student had to answer the questions by lowering one of the 4 switches placed in
                        front of him, connected to 4 light signals visible by the teacher. In case of wrong answer, the
                        teacher had to inflict a punishment, increasing the intensity of the shock with each student
                        error.
                        <br>
                        </br>
                        Different experimental conditions were envisaged with 4 levels of distance, from not being able
                        to observe and hear the moans to pushing the victim's arm directly onto a plate. The conflict
                        between moral conscience and received orders, visible through sweating, lip biting, stammering
                        or nervous laughter, was triggered when the pupil, pretending, expressed his discomfort: at 75
                        volts the first moans were heard, at 120 loud cries of protest, 150 the request that the
                        experiment be suspended, 270 excruciating cries of agony and from 300 onwards neither voices nor
                        cries were heard, but only silence. When some teacher expressed concern to continue, the
                        experimenter ordered him to continue telling him that his responsibility was not his and
                        reassuring him that although the electric shocks were extremely painful, they did not cause
                        permanent damage. The experiment ceased when the teacher refused to continue or when he
                        administered at least three shocks of maximum intensity.
                        <br>
                        </br>
                        The results were surprising. While manifesting tension and protesting strongly, the 40
                        experimental subjects yielded to the authority of the experimenter, silencing their conscience,
                        giving all the shock of 300 volts; 62.5% continued until the 450 volts discharge.
                        <br>
                        Milgram explained this amazing result by speaking of the <strong>heteronomic state</strong>: a
                        person inserted in an authoritarian system passes from an autonomous state to a heteronomic
                        state in which he no longer feels free to act, as he must satisfy the requests, expectations and
                        needs of others.
                        <br>
                        </br> 
                        With this experiment Milgram demonstrated that the justifications put forward by Adolf Eichmann
                        and the other criminals of the Nazi concentration camps, that is, that they limited themselves
                        to following the orders of their superiors, anesthetizing their own conscience, were not
                        pretexts. It follows that authority can induce any ordinary person to follow orders, even to the
                        extent of killing an innocent human being.
