                            As a student of psychology, the first question that people often ask me is: “Can you tell me
                            what’s the meaning of that dream I made last day?”
                            <br>
                            I get it! Psychology is often associated with <strong>Freud</strong>, the father of psychoanalysis and the
                            first to formulate a theory of dream interpretation, but dreams are only a small part
                            treated in a psychoanalytic setting.
                            <br>

                            <img src="../Images/freud.png" class="rounded float-right" alt="freud">
                            Starting from the beginning, Freud (<a href="https://books.google.it/books?hl=it&lr=&id=U0t8CgAAQBAJ&oi=fnd&pg=PT9&dq=the+interpretation+of+dreams+freud&ots=Y5EHqB47G1&sig=8Z7BvXTMaxAqgeciiYpRxNsIUFs&redir_esc=y#v=onepage&q=the%20interpretation%20of%20dreams%20freud&f=false
                            " target="_blank">1900</a>)
                            explains that sources of dreams include stimuli from the external world, subjective
                            experiences, organic stimuli within the body, and mental activities during sleep.
                            For instance, empirical evidence (<a href="10.3389/fpsyg.2016.00332" target="_blank">Zhang,
                                2016</a>) supported that memory
                            consolidation, emotion regulation and reception of external stimuli can contribute to dream
                            content.
                            <br>
                            </br>
                            Freud suggested that some connection between real life and dreams are not random, but
                            constrained by one’s unconscious desires. Along these lines, the interpretation of dreams
                            can help understand the <strong>unconscious</strong>, which try to emerge in our sleep.
                            <br>
                            This conception about dreams, as a way for the unconscious to bypass the consciousness and
                            express inadmissible desires, has dominated for more than half a century.

                            <strong>Bion</strong> (<a href="https://books.google.it/books?hl=it&lr=&id=elqqliHDYIcC&oi=fnd&pg=PP1&dq=Learning+from+Experience+bion&ots=alCqvdi_lD&sig=M3uzBi79PdO-9i5p4XH-AU3FLks#v=onepage&q=Learning%20from%20Experience%20bion&f=false

                            " target="_blank">1992b</a>) did a revolution and took into consideration just the psychic
                            phenomenon of dreaming
                            rather that the dream as an unconscious content to be deciphered. He was concerned more with
                            the way we dream than with the dream’s symbolic content.
                            <br>
                            He described the dream as an essential function of the human mind: a result of a
                            transformation from what he called <strong>beta element</strong>, the very first sensory matrix on which
                            thought develops, into <strong>alpha element</strong>, which resemble the visual images with which we are
                            familiar in dreams.
                            <br>
                            </br>
                            According to this idea, the alpha function promotes the growth of thoughts; it produces
                            alpha elements, suitable for use in dream-thinking and waking-unconscious thinking.
                            In fact, he interprets dreaming as the unconscious processing of emotional experience, which
                            occurs continuously and simultaneously with conscious thinking: both when we are awake and
                            asleep. During sleep, the dream takes advantage of the suspension of consciousness, the
                            dream activity makes possible those emotional experiences that could not be reached in the
                            waking state. Bion hypothesizes the existence of a dream function that is also active in the
                            waking state, even though shielded by perceptions and distractions operated in reality.
                            With Bion, the dream is released from the state of consciousness and no longer needs sleep
                            to exist.
                            <br>
                            The patient would take the dream into analysis in the hope of receiving the analyst’s help
                            in
                            completing the unconscious intolerable work, but dreams are themeselves the way we have
                            already
                            interpreted the facts.
                            <br>
                            Bionian thought has led several authors to equate the activity of dream thinking with the
                            mental activity of waking, emphasizing the function of both of developing, maintaining and
                            re-establishing the psychological organization of the self and the regulation of affects.
                            <br>

                            We are close to the procedure that <strong>A. Ferro</strong> has called «transformations in dreams»,
                            that is when the analyst mentally introduce the predicate "I had a dream" to the patient's
                            communication, whatever it may be. This linguistic-cognitive ritual, immediately strips the
                            external reality of its significance, predisposing the analyst to the “dreamiest” attention
                            possible.
                            <br>
                            </br>
                            Ferro (<a
                                href="https://books.google.it/books/about/Psicoanalisi_oggi.html?id=HLzSMgEACAAJ&redir_esc=y"
                                target="_blank">2013</a>)
                            supports the need to reconstruct every communication as if it were a dream, and the need for
                            patient and analyst to dream together.
                            <br>
                            The dream allows the analyst to work on the patient's alpha function, but also on his own,
                            through a sort of training in the multiplicity of perspectives that the dream story offers.
                            Within the analytic field, the dream remains the main monitoring tool, since it represents
                            one of the most creative ways that the patient has to communicate his analytic experiences.
                            <br>
                            </br>
                            With Ferro, there are no external, internal or transfert communications that do not belong
                            to the setting within the analysis and that cannot be considered <strong>narrative derivatives</strong> of
                            the dreamlike thought of waking. Even the more subjective elements such as the patient's
                            dream belong to the field to signify and signal the movements of the waking dream related to
                            the movement in which the dream is narrated. The field allows you to describe and collect
                            emotions, clarifying and focusing them, using the <strong>characters</strong> of the setting, who lose their
                            historical-referential status, to assume the characteristic of transformative processes of
                            the analytic couple.
                            <br>
                            </br>
                            So, finally, Ferro tells us that dreams should not be hardly interpreted: they are the
                            clearest and simplest story and should be easy to understand. The process of attributing
                            meaning to the dream, more than its symbolic decoding, can lead to recognizing oneself in
                            its functioning and bringing out the need to arrive at a new, more complex, identity
                            reality.
