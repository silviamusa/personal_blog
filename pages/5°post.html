                            Lots of people during this COVID-19 pandemic had strange dreams. The pandemic has caused
                            massive social disruption and a global recession, that led to cancelation of political,
                            religious and cultural events and has caused million of people to work from home, or worse,
                            to lose their job. So people have been very stressed and have been proving a lot of negative
                            emotions.
                            <br>
                            </br>
                            In the past, other crises and traumatic events have influenced dream contents toward more
                            anxious and negative dreams. This has been shown by the 11th September 2001, terrorist
                            attacks, the Oakland/Berkley firestorm and detention of allied troops in Nazi
                            prisoner-of-war camps during World War II.
                            <br>
                            </br>
                            Given these evidence, Deirdre Barrett has collected dreams about the COVID-19 pandemic from
                            2,888 dreamers via an online survey conducted between 23rd March and 15th July and compared
                            them to normative dreams from an earlier period. She used a text analysis program called
                            <a href="http://liwc.wpengine.com/" alt="Source site" target="_blank">Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count (LIWC)</a> to quantify
                            nine target dreaming themes: positive emotions, negative emotions, anxiety, anger, sadness,
                            biological processes, body, health, and death.
                            Then she compared the results to a database of dreams from before the pandemic.

                                    pandemic began, I was interested to see how these dreams would be similar to other
                                    crises and any distinctive elements they might have.

                            The survey was filled in by 1,998 women and 890 men, from 18 to 91 years, with a mean of
                            40.08 and an SD of 16.89. As predicted by the hypothesis, for female respondents, the mean
                            showed significantly lower positive emotions in their dreams and higher rates of negative
                            emotions, anxiety, health and death. For male respondents, the predicted higher score for
                            the variables health and death were the only one significant at as high a level as for
                            women.
                            <br>
                            </br>
                            Death was the variable with the largest difference for both genders and it is even higher
                            than
                            anxiety. The reason could be that waking reactions to the pandemic include not only obvious
                            fears of dying of the virus but also reflections on human mortality and remembrances of
                            deceased loved ones.

                                    Our dreams are more anxious since the pandemic began and we’re dreaming about it in
                                    a variety of ways — direct and metaphoric. Both men and women’s dreams reflect a lot
                                    of fear, and more references to illness and death than in normal times. However,
                                    these effects are even more pronounced for women, who also have more sadness, anger
                                    and other unpleasant body themes that are not significant for men.

                        Dreams about death aren't just classic horror-film fare, as one with woman who wanders
                        into a mortuary which she discovers is embalming live COVID-19 patients, but are also
                        peaceful. One dreamer attended alovely family picnic with beloved dead relatives; another had a visit
                        from herdeceased mother and aunt who told her it was “time to come with us,” and she
                        washappily led away.

                        <br>
                        </br>
                        In conclusion, the largest difference between pandemic and pre-pandemic dreams was
                        death-related themes. Death themes were more than three times higher for pandemic dreams
                        compared to normative ones. Moreover, women’s dreams have been more negatively affected by
                        the COVID-19 pandemic than men’s dreams.
