                                Well-meaning adults often try to shield children from hearing about upsetting
                                situations
                                in the family. They tell them to leave the room, or they whisper among themselves.
                                Adults believe they can protect children from the stress and anxiety that they
                                themselves may be feeling. Whether it’s from financial concerns or perhaps the
                                illness
                                of a relative, children tend to pick up on what is happening. They often recognize
                                the
                                upsets in the family, and by trying to protect them, we can potentially make their
                                stress levels worse.
                                <br>
                                Right now, there is a lot of fear and upset in the world. Whether it‘s the
                                uncertainty
                                of the COVID-19 virus or the divisive political atmosphere in the country, people
                                are
                                scared, they often feel uneasy, and this can lead to feeling a lot of pressure.
                                Millions
                                of families have jobs that have been lost or are in jeopardy. Many families face
                                uncertainty and don’t know what the future is going to bring. Children pick up on
                                this.
                                They can feel your concerns and worries. It’s important that someone talks to them
                                to
                                let them know that they are going to be safe. They need to be informed, in
                                child-appropriate language, that even though things in the world are uncertain,
                                their
                                families are secure. They need to be reassured that they don’t have to worry; they
                                are
                                going to be cared for.

                                <br>
                                When I was 7 years old, my family was struggling financially. We lived in a small
                                apartment and one day, I overheard my parents discussing that their rent was due.
                                They
                                said they didn’t know how they were going to pay it and were worried about whether
                                or
                                not they could keep the apartment. As a 7-year-old, this scared me a great deal.
                                This
                                was my home. This was the place where all of my belongings were and I became worried
                                about what the future was going to bring. Fortunately, my parents were able to
                                secure
                                the funds to pay the rent and we continued to live in the apartment. However, as a
                                small
                                child, I was overwhelmed because I didn’t know that at the time. I was scared that I
                                would have to leave my home because of my family’s financial difficulties.
                                <br>
                                That moment has stuck with me my whole life. The fear and worry I felt that day was
                                very
                                unsettling. I had no ability to have any control in the situation and felt my home
                                was
                                at risk. I thought we might have to move and I had no idea where we might go. This
                                created a lot of fear about my finances as I grew older. I was often scared I would
                                not
                                have enough and it caused me a lot of anxiety over the years.
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                If you have children in your home, don’t shut them out when the family is going
                                through
                                difficult times. Share with them in child-appropriate language what is going on. Let
                                them know that no matter what difficulties may be happening in the family, they are
                                going to be safe. This doesn’t mean giving them details that might be above their
                                ability to grasp or might scare them. It means reassuring them that, even if times
                                are
                                difficult, they will be cared for.
                                <br>
                                When stress is present in a household, more often than not, children feel it. They
                                need
                                an adult to reassure them that things will be all right, that they are not at great
                                risk, and that the adults in their lives are going to handle the situation and keep
                                them
                                safe. In this way, children can grow up secure in the knowledge that their families
                                have
                                shared with them what is going on in their family so that they don’t feel
                                overwhelmed by
                                the emotional stress that may be present in the household.
