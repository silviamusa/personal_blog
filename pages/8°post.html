                            Nowadays parents may feel like they are not being the best model to their children, spending
                            too little time with them or even have the impression of being losing the big moments of
                            their children’s development. Well, if you’re asking yourself these questions, you are on
                            the right track to be a “good-enough” parent.

                            One of the most challenging aspects of being a parent is to find balance between the
                            well-being of the child and the well-being of the parent. As
                            <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20846799/" alt="Source site"
                                target="_blank">studies</a> have shown, parenting
                            well requires a well parent, therefore depressed or stressed parents are likely to transfer
                            their emotions to their children.
                            <br>
                            </br>
                            Distressed mothers, for example, tend to be less responsive and to bond with them in a
                            disrupted manner. A parent’s own experience of being a child and the way they were parented
                            can influence their parenting. In the same way, mental problems, illness, education level or
                            socio-economic factors can affect the parent-child relationships and children development.
                            <br>
                            </br>
                            It is important to comprehend that, even even though childrens can fall under different
                            categories (commonly speaking: the quiet child, the euphoric, the aggressive, etc.), every
                            child is unique and, therefore, has its own way to show happiness, sadness, hunger, sorrow,
                            needs, etc.
                            <br>
                            Thus, my suggestion is to avoid considering sources such as tv or the internet as reliable
                            means of parenthood rather focus on finding your own way to understand each other’s needs.
                            <br>
                            </br>
                            Good caregivers start their parenthood with a complete adaptation to their baby's needs, but
                            as the child grows this bond of dependency needs to decrease, or simply change, to let the
                            child explore the environment, aware of the presence of a secure base where to return if
                            scared, anguished or confused.
                            <br>
                            </br>
                            As children grow, the attachment with their caregivers is developed and, as <a

                            psychologist, psychiatrist, and psychoanalyst, would say, early experiences in childhood are
                            important for influencing development and behavior later in life.
                            <br>
                            Thanks to Bowlby’s attachment theory, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mary_Ainsworth"
                                alt="Source site" target="_blank">M. Ainsworth</a> developed the assessment known as
                            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strange_situation" alt="Source site"
                                target="_blank">strange situation</a> from which
                            she could identify three attachment styles. Later, <a

                                show happiness when they return. When afraid, these children will seek comfort from
                                their parents.<a

                                demonstrate that secure children are more empathetic during later

                                avoidance or resistance. They are described as displaying confused behavior, sometimes
                                seeming either puzzled or apprehensive in the presence of a parent.

                        parenthood,
                        but they can be influenced by. There is no doubt that parents’ education approach
                        can and does make a difference in the development of their children, but it’s not the only
                        factor that influences their growth: their own temperament, social life and cultural environment
                        are other factors that can also impact the development of their little ones.

                        Concluding, it is relevant to be part of your children's development, listen to their needs,
                        which are often not-communicated, and try to ensure you know the most about their lives, giving
                        them love and space to explore the world.
