                            Even with just a moment’s reflection, it’s easy to think of an individual in power as a
                            person with a selfish, combative, and manipulative personalities - whether in business,
                            politics, academia, or the arts. Seeing a disagreeable person in power prompts a question
                            that is profoundly important and yet that has received insufficient empirical attention:
                            </br>
                            Are disagreeable individuals more likely to attain power than agreeable individuals?
                            </br>
                            </br>
                            This question is important because highly disagreeable individuals in positions of power can
                            do a lot of damage. For example, CEOs who are nasty and bullying create cultures of abuse
                            and tend to lead their organizations to fail.
                            </br>
                            </br>
                            Disagreeable people who are powerful (and, thus, visible) can have toxic far-reaching
                            effects and can also serve as antisocial role models and encourage others to behave more
                            disagreeably. When people see a disagreeable person in power, they might conclude that being
                            disagreeable will help them attain power and, in turn, behave more disagreeably. If such a
                            belief is inaccurate, it is important to empirically dispel this myth.
                            </br>
                            Power is a fundamental principle that organizes relationships within virtually all
                            social-living species. It is defined as the capacity to influence others by providing or
                            withholding resources or administering punishments. Power differences provide a heuristic
                            for how resources, prerequisites, and control are allocated.
                            </br>
                            </br>
                            A new research of Professor Cameron Anderson of the University of California, Berkeley,
                            conducted personality assessments of thousands of undergraduate and MBA students at three
                            American universities, which throws doubt on this, indicating unpleasant people are no more
                            likely to make a quick rise up the corporate ladder. An average of 14 years later 671 of
                            these agreed to follow up interviews that were used to estimate how powerful their current
                            job was, and the culture of the organization where they worked. Almost a third of
                            participants were part of a study that asked more detailed questions and confirmed findings
                            with interviews of coworkers.
                            </br>
                            </br>
                            Two preregistered prospective longitudinal studies found a null relationship between
                            disagreeableness and power. Disagreeable individuals, who behave in aggressive, selfish, and
                            manipulative ways, did not attain more power than agreeable individuals over time. In
                            contrast, both studies found a consistent and robust relation-ship between extraversion and
                            power.
                            </br>
                            The null correlation they observed indicates that organizations place disagreeable
                            individuals in powerful positions at the same rate they do agreeable individuals. Nasty
                            individuals reach the top just as often as nice individuals.

                                    power – even in more cutthroat, 'dog-eat-dog' organizational cultures.

                            On the other hand, it doesn't seem to hurt either.
                            For instance, Anderson and co-authors findings suggest that being disagreeable did not help
                            those individuals gain their powerful position. Instead, their problematic behavior might be
                            a product of occupying a powerful position. In other words, while the possession of power
                            can foster disagreeable behavior, disagreeable behavior does not appear to help people gain
                            power.
                            </br>
                            </br>
                            The results of their studies supported the compensatory hypothesis they had. Disagreeable
                            individuals did not attain higher power because they engaged in two different patterns of
                            behavior that offset each other’s effects. They engaged in dominant-aggressive behavior,
                            which predicted higher power, but also engaged in fewer communal behaviors, which predicted
                            lower power. These two effects, when combined, canceled each other out and led to an overall
                            null correlation between disagreeableness and power.
                            </br>
                            </br>
                            The traits that predicted career success were unsurprising. People described as extroverted,
                            assertive, energetic, and sociable by their classmates were more likely to end up in
                            positions of power.
                            </br>
                            </br>
                            So if people in powerful positions are not intrinsically nastier than the rest of us, why do
                            we suspect otherwise? One possibility is that it is purely perception; a person with a
                            typical mix of decency and selfishness will seem cruel simply by virtue of the harm their
                            decisions can cause to those below. On the other hand, the authors acknowledge, it is
                            possible that acquiring power changes enough of us that the perception is true, but only
                            because ordinary people have been twisted by their jobs.
