                        <p class="card-text"> Cortico-Basal Degeneration (CBD: Cortico-Basal Degeneration), or Rebeiz
                            syndrome, was first discovered in 1968 by Rebeiz, Kolodny, and Richardson. During the
                            clinical examination of three adult patients, the researchers identified the presence of a
                            neurological pathology characterized by deficits in muscle movements, involuntary motor
                            activities and initially preserved mental faculties. Post-mortem examination led to the
                            discovery of a new disease that the researchers called "corticodentatonigral degeneration
                            with neuronal achromatism" (Rebeiz et al., 1968).

                            CBD is part of a group of diseases called "Parkinsonisms Plus", defined in this way because
                            they present signs and symptoms that recall Parkinson's disease, from which they take their
                            name. CBD is a very rare neurodegenerative disease, affecting only 1% of patients clinically
                            diagnosed with parkinsonism (Stamenova et al., 2009). It is an asymmetric, akinetic-rigid
                            syndrome, characterized by progressive degeneration of some areas of the brain, in
                            particular the frontal, parietal and basal ganglia (Dickson et al., 2002).

                        <h4>1.1 - Limb apraxia: brief introduction and interpretative models</h4>
                        <p class="card-text">
                            Motor disturbances have been found to be the first to be observed in patients with CBS (CBS:
                            Cortico-Basal Syndrome) and among these the most common is ideomotor apraxia, or limb
                            apraxia
                            (Graham et al., 2003).
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            Limb apraxia is one of the most recognized types of apraxia and, although it is defined as
                            the inability to perform specialized movements, it is not caused by sensorimotor or
                            comprehension deficits. It usually occurs as a result of left parietal lesions, although it
                            can often occur as a result of extrapyramidal lesions.
                            <br>
                            Apraxia was first observed by John Hughlings Jackson, in 1861, in patients with aphasia, who
                            showed an inability to perform simple limb movements (Pearce JM, 2009). However, he did not
                            give this disorder the name by which it is still recognized.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            To date, there are various interpretative models that explain the behavior of this
                            phenomenon and its evolution, hypothesizing the internal structures involved in the
                            behavioral manifestation of this disorder. In the <u>Figure 1</u>&nbsp are specified the
                            main interpretative models developed from 1900 to the one developed by Buxbaum.

                        Hugo Karl Liepmann was the first to introduce the term "apraxia" in 1900, distinguishing its
                        multiple types (ideomotor, ideational and kinetic), which can affect different areas of
                        association in the cerebral cortex. Liepmann argued that the representation of an action was
                        stored in the left sensorimotor cortical areas, from which it reached the left or right primary
                        motor areas via the corpus callosum, allowing the execution of the movement. According to the
                        researcher, subjects with limb apraxia presented an interruption of the fronto-parietal
                        connections between the two hemispheres, which therefore caused a deficit in the execution of
                        the movement (Pearce J.M., 2009).
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Geschwind later defined limb apraxia as a disconnection syndrome between motor areas and
                        conceptual areas. This disconnection, which involved in particular the supramarginal gyrus,
                        which is located between the Wernicke area and the frontal cortex, would be the cause of an
                        impairment in the execution of movements (Geschwind, 1965).
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        In 1982, De Renzi and Faglioni suggested a model in which the Praxic center was located in the
                        left parietal lobe, which was connected to the left premotor cortex. According to this model,
                        apraxia would be caused by a disconnection between the areas that process the information and
                        the areas where the movement is programmed (De Renzi et al., 1982).
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Heilman and colleagues, in 1997, proposed the existence of two components within the model of
                        practice: one of execution and production (earlier) and the other conceptual-representative
                        (later). According to this model, the representation of the action is stored in the left
                        inferior parietal lobe; to perform a movement, the signal is sent to the premotor cortex, which
                        is located in the frontal (anterior) lobe. According to Heilman and Rothi, therefore, damage to
                        the anterior areas would cause a deficit in the execution and production components of the
                        movements (Heilman et al., 1997).
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Finally, Buxbaum (2001) proposed a model of practice in which representations of actions are
                        stored in the inferior parietal lobe. Consequently, damage to this area would result in impaired
                        recognition and production of specialized actions (Buxbaum, 2001).

                        <p>The classic clinical presentation of CBD is characterized by a progressive asymmetric motor
                            dysfunction, which presents symptoms such as rigidity, myoclonia and the phenomenon of the
                            alien hand, initially in a specific limb. Later, the disease also extends to other limbs and
                            can affect gait and cognitive function (Armstrong R.A., 2016).

                        <p class="card-text">The extrapyramidal characteristics of CBD emerge from the onset of the
                            disease and are the most common manifestations recorded in patients. They include some motor

                            commonly observed in CBD, among which the most important are: limb apraxia, alien hand
                            phenomenon and cortical sensory loss.

                            the most described form of apraxia in CBD and is characterized by the inability to perform a
                            movement when prompted on verbal command or performed on imitation.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            From an analysis of the frequency of cortical features in CBD patients observed in brain
                            banks and in studies presenting a sample of at least 5 cases presenting CBD, performed by
                            Armstrong et al. (2013), it was concluded that 46/102 (45%) of cases have limb apraxia since
                            the onset of the disease; while in 81/142 (57%) limb apraxia was diagnosed during the
                            progression of the disease.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            Evaluating the presence of limb apraxia in patients with CBD is particularly difficult,
                            especially if the subjects have already developed other typical motor manifestations of CBD,
                            such as limb stiffness, dystonia, and myoclonia. Certainly, a systematic assessment of
                            apraxia can facilitate the differential diagnosis between patients with CBS or other similar
                            clinical syndromes.
                        </p>
                        <h4>2.2 - Diagnostic criteria</h4>
                        <p class="card-text">Several sets of diagnostic criteria have been proposed over the years, all
                            of which focus primarily on the phenotypic spectrum of CBD. Among all, the most recognized
                            are: the criteria of Lang et al. (1994), Boeve et al. (2003) and those of Bak and Hodges
                            (2009).
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            These sets of criteria have some characteristics in common. Indeed, all three agree that
                            CBS, i.e. the classic clinical presentation of CBD, is characterized by the presence of
                            cortical dysfunction, such as ideomotor apraxia, alien limb phenomenon, cortical or sensory
                            loss, and extrapyramidal dysfunction, such as stiffness, myoclonia or dystonia. Despite
                            this, none of the three criteria specify at which stage of the disease these characteristics
                            should present themselves.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            However, the three criteria also have some differences between them and due to the various
                            discrepancies between the methods of diagnosing CBS, it is difficult to determine which of
                            these criteria is the most valid and reliable in diagnosing CBS.
                        </p>
                        <h5>2.2.1 - Armstrong's criteria</h5>
                        <p class="card-text">In 2013, Armstrong et al. introduced a new diagnostic criterion, based on a
                            careful critical analysis of the literature of CBD clinical pathological studies and on the
                            collection of original data from brain banks, which collects all the different phenotypes
                            and various clinical syndromes that CBD can present.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            This review also suggested that CBD may also be associated with other clinical syndromes
                            other than classic CBS. From an examination of 210 cases of CBD, collected from the
                            literature, 4 clinical phenotypes associated with this pathology emerged (Armstrong et al.,
                            2013):
                        <ul>
                            <li>CBS (probable and possible);</li>
                            <li>FBS (Frontal Behavioral-spatial Syndrome): frontal spatial behavioral syndrome;
                            </li>
                            <li>naPPA (Nonfluent / Agrammatic variant of Primary Progressive Aphasia): non-fluid /
                                agrammatic variant of primary progressive aphasia;</li>
                            <li>PSPS (Progressive Supranuclear Palsy Syndrome): syndrome of progressive supranuclear
                                palsy.</li>
                        </ul>
                        </p>
                        <h3>4 - Impairments in motor tasks in patients with cortico-basal syndrome</h3>
                        <p class="card-text">CBS is, in short, a movement disorder that results from a lesion of
                            cortical and subcortical areas. Specifically, a particular type of voluntary movement
                            disorder, namely limb apraxia, is included in the diagnosis criteria for CBS.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            Limb apraxia is characterized by the inability to imitate gestures and / or perform
                            pantomimes; the latter consists in the mimic demonstration of the use of an object or of a
                            sequence of actions with an object.
                            <br>
                        <figure style="float:left; padding-right:2px;"><img src="../Images/2°post.png"
                                class="img-responsive" alt="Modello" style="width:500;height:310;">
                            <figcaption><small>Figure 2 - Production-conceptual model of praxis by Roy (1996).</small>
                            </figcaption>
                        </figure>
                        In 1996, Roy proposed an information processing model consisting of three distinct systems, as
                        shown in <u>Figure 2</u>:a sensorial / perceptive system, a conceptual system and a production
                        system. The sensory / perceptive system deals with processing the information received from the
                        environment, which can be visual, auditory or tactile. The second system is dedicated to
                        memorizing the knowledge of gestures regarding actions and the use of tools and objects.
                        Finally, the production system is divided into other subsystems, which together deal with the
                        selection of the response, the generation of images, the storage of working memory and the
                        organization of the response and motion control.
                        <br>
                        Injury to one of these pathways results in a specific pattern of praxis deficit. It is therefore
                        necessary to perform a thorough evaluation of the various gestural performances in different
                        modalities and for multiple types of gestures, in order to be able to determine which particular
                        system of practice has been affected.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Since CBS is a progressive neurodegenerative disease, over time it tends to also affect
                        cognitive functions and, consequently, decreases the ability of patients to understand and be
                        able to perform complex tasks. It is therefore important to evaluate patients in praxic tasks,
                        as well as in cognitive and neuropsychological tests, at the onset of the disease.
                        </p>
                        <h3>5 - Conclusion</h3>
                        <p class="card-text">Limb apraxia is evident in the production and execution of specific limb
                            movements and is usually present early in the onset of CBS: a progressive neurodegenerative
                            parkinsonian disease characterized by motor system dysfunction and multiple cognitive
                            deficits.
                            <br>
                            Although limb apraxia initially manifests in only one limb, the disorder can expand over
                            time to involve others. This worsening of apraxia is caused by the progression of CBS, which
                            over time extends and damages other brain areas, in addition to the fronto-parietal ones.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            CBS and limb apraxia share the same neuroanatomical correlates: at the cortical level,
                            lesions occur mainly in the frontal and parietal areas, while at the subcortical level,
                            dysfunctions of the white matter and basal ganglia can be observed.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            It is important to recognize the initial symptoms of limb apraxia in CBS before CBS
                            progresses, so that appropriate and managed treatment can be given to the patient in a
                            multidisciplinary rehabilitation setting. For this reason, it is necessary to perform an
                            analysis of the praxis components in a detailed clinical examination, examining the patient
                            in the various modes and types of gestures described above. In order to understand which
                            systems of the practice model are damaged and which intervention is most effective for the
                            individual patient, it is useful to take note of the type and quantity of errors made by the
                            patient in the evaluation phase.
